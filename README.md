# Rust Manifest

An automatically updating list of Rust projects on Github.

Seperate out projects that have been updated in the past month and those that have not.

project name | author | build status | last commit / date | [ docs ] | forks | star

* project name should link to the project page,
* author to the author's github page
* build status to the build status
* last commit to the commits page
* Fork and star do what they would do if one is logged into github. Show the number and icon for both.
* docs will do nothing. I may attempt to run rustdoc on projects automatically/manually, but do that after the core listing processes work.


One big table.

Once the list is in place and works, perhaps consider some kind of ranking?

======

astavonin/RustyKext is an example Rust project that won't be found with the criteria of a Rust language project created after 2010 because it is majority C. Need a way for people to add projects to track.
